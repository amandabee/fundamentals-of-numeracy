## Short essay example:

Thoroughout the city of Springfield, hospitals devote an average of 6% of their operating budgets to their cardiac surgery departments. Springfield Municipal, however, devotes 15% of its budget to cardiac surgery. Springfield Municipal averages 7 deaths per 1,000 open-heart surgeries, compared to a rate of 2.3 among other Springfield hospitals. Clearly, Springfield Municipal is misspending its cardiac funds.

Is this conclusion fair? Why or why not? 

## Possible answers

1. Just because Springfield Municipal is spending more than twice of its budget proportionally on heart surgery doesnâ€™t mean that it is spending more money overall. If its budget is $10 million, 15% of that is $1.5 million. However, if the average hospital has a budget of $100 million and thus spends $6 million on cardiac surgery, then the average hospital actually spends 4 times as much as Springfield Municipal in absolute terms.

2. The mortality rate says nothing about the health of the patients that Springfield Municipal sees. If Municipal is considered to have the best cardiac surgery team in the city, then it may also be the hospital in which highest risk cardiac patients are sent. Therefore, we need to know the expected mortality rate of cardiac patients for each hospital in order to make an apples-to-apples comparison.

## Questions:

1. For every 100,000 people, at least 48 die annually from knife-related accidents. In comparison, only 0.5 deaths per 100,000 people can be attributed to hand grenades. Therefore, hand grenades are nearly 100 times safer than knives.


2. In a random sampling of deaths among 18 to 40-year olds who consumed an average of 3 alcoholic beverages a week, nearly 35 percent of the deaths were alcohol-related, e.g. accidents and liver disease. However, in a sampling of deaths among 80 to 100-year olds who consumed at least 5 alcoholic beverages a week, only 20 percent of the deaths were alcohol-related. Therefore, we can conclude that drinking more alcohol will reduce your chances of having an alcohol-related death.

3. When a movie franchise has at least one sequel, the franchise averages $25 million more in revenue per movie than the average individual movie. Therefore, given an original screenplay, a movie studio should prepare to film a sequel as soon as possible, in order to maximize revenue.

4. From the year 2008 to 2012, SAT scores among Springfield High seniors jumped 38%. Shelbyville High seniors, however, had a 1% drop in overall SAT scores. Therefore, we can conclude that Springfield High graduates will have a better chance of going to a prestigious college.

5. In the year 2000, the suburb Deerfield had a deer population that averaged 2.4 per acre. In that year, there were only 3,800 concealed-carry firearm permits on file for Deerfield residents. In 2010, however, the deer population fell to an average of 0.6 an acre, whereas concealed-carry firearm permits increased to more than 40,000. From this, we can conclude that Deerfield gun ownership is to blame for the decrease in deer population.
