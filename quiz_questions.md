> "Figures show that, while the percentage of the English population with literacy skills equivalent to GCSE A* to C grade has risen from 44 per cent to 57 per cent between 2003 and 2011, equivalent numeracy skills have declined from 26 per cent to 22 per cent in the same period." **[Shame celebrities who boast about poor maths, says numeracy charity ](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/shame-celebrities-who-boast-about-poor-maths-says-numeracy-charity-9734152.html), The Independent - Sept 16, 2014**

> "...according to a new study from VoucherCloud and published by the L.A. Times, 1 in every 9 Americans–or exactly 11%–think HTML is actually a sexually transmitted disease." **[Study: 11% of Americans Think HTML Is an STD](http://time.com/12410/11-of-americans-think-html-is-an-std/), Time - Mar 4, 2014**

Is 11% exactly 1 in 9?

VoucherCloud surveyed 2,392 people. How many indicated that they think HTML is an STD?

Note: The original LA Times story had slightly different (and more accurate) phrasing -- "A recent study found that many Americans are lost when it comes to tech-related terms, with 11% in a survey saying that they thought HTML — a language that is used to create websites — was a sexually transmitted disease." [1 in 10 in a survey think HTML is an STD](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-1-10-americans-html-std-study-finds-20140304-story.html). There are good questions worth asking about VoucherCloud (who are they?) before you draw too many conclusions from this study. [iMediaEthics](http://www.imediaethics.org/News/4422/Latimes__time__buzzfeed_cite_poll_10_america_thinks_html_is_a_std.php) offers a lengthy critique of the press the study got.

In Ferguson, Mo. the population is 21,203 and there are 54 police officers, 83% of whom are white. If the police force is 55 percentage points more white than the population, what percent of the population of Ferguson is white?
