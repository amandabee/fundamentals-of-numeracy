#Fundamentals of Numeracy 

Note that this "lecture" includes the index and markdown for a [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentation, but does not actually include reveal.js or the `cuny.css` theme that I use. 

If you want to snag my theme for some reason (maybe you, too, would like to use CUNY colors?) knock yourself out. If you want to see a relatively recent version of this deck in the wild, there's [one on my website](http://freegreentea.info/talks/numeracy) alongside a great many other [talks](http://freegreentea.info/talks/).
