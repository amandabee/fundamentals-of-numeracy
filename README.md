#Fundamentals of Numeracy 

In this repository you'll find a number of slide decks, handouts and quizzes that I use to teach numeracy to writers. You'll also find answer keys to my quizzes. If you want to memorize a bunch of arbitrary "right" answers instead of doing your best on a quiz and then asking for help when you realize you still aren't getting it, I won't stop you. But it seems crazy to me.
