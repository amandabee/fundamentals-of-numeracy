# Math for Journalists (A Cheatsheet)

## Know These Numbers

Look these numbers up and fill them in. Note your sources, and the year of the data.

Population: 
World ________ US ________ New York City_______
Median household income: 
US ________ New York City ________

Minimum Wage:
Federal ________ New York ________

Federal Poverty Level: ____________
*Bonus: how is the “poverty level” determined?*

Inflation:
Average inflation since the 20s ____________

Dow Jones range ______________________

NASDAQ range  ________________________ 

You should have a basic sense of proportion. 

## Rounding

5 and above rounds up; 4 and below rounds down. Avoid false precision by rounding off. To round to the nearest thousand, find the digit to the right -- the hundreds. If it is between 0-4, round down. If it is 5-9 round up.

## Percents

Percent is literally "per hundred" -- how many of a thing there are per hundred things. Calculate a percent:

    (part ÷ whole) * 100 = percent

The whole is 100%. Parts of a whole should always add up to 100% -- if they don't, figure out why! Know the basics: 50% is half, 33% is one-third, 67% is two-thirds. Know how to calculate a number from a percent, too.

    part = (percent * whole) ÷ 100
    whole = (part ÷ percent) * 100

### Percentage Points are not percents
 
Percentage points: the arithmetic difference between two percentages. If polls show that Candidate A has the support of 30% of voters, while Candidate B has the support of 40%, Candidate B is leading by 10 points. If he were leading by 10%, you'd have to ask "of what"?

## Other Rates
A percent is just one expression of rate. Sometimes, the rate per 100 is not the most useful figure. Only 0.00505% of New Yorkers were murdered last year. That's probably a good thing, but it isn't a very useful figure. Knowing that there were 5.05 murders per 100,000 New Yorkers is a bit more useful. 

A rate is always something per some other thing. A "percapita" rate is the rate per person. Births and income we often measure per capita. Percent we covered. Some data is provided per 100 or per 1000 or per 100,000. The right figure to use depends on the circumstances but you can always calculate the rate just the way you calculate the percent:

    (part ÷ whole) * 1000 = rate per thousand

## Percent Change
Difference / Origin * 100

(old-new)/old *100



## Percent Difference
`(old-new)/old *100`


## Median vs. Mean
The "median" is the middlemost value. The "mean" you calculate by taking the sum of all numbers

The median is a better figure to use when there are drastic outliers -- one person with billions of dollars can throw off the mean wealth of a community of middle income people. But when people say "average" we usually mean the "mean", but often the mean is not an accurate representation of the typical experience. 

And sometimes, you don't actually know the outliers. It is typical for housing data to be given broken down by the number of bedrooms in each unit, from 0 to 5+ -- if we don't know how many bedrooms each home has, we can't calculate the mean number of bedrooms in a housing unit, but we can still calculate the median. 

Use the median when outliers would distort the mean, or when your values have no ceiling or no floor (real estate, CEO salaries). Otherwise, use the mean.

# Advanced Topics

## Inflation

Inflation: a continual increase in the price of goods and services over time. As a result of inflation, a single dollar buys a little bit less stuff today than it did a year or two ago. A "nominal" price is a price that has not been adjusted for inflation. 

Comparing spending or prices over time without adjusting for inflation is useless at best. Sometimes it is plain dishonest. You can calculate inflation yourself, or you can use the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator: <http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm> -- I recommend the calculator.

## Margin of Error
If a number is based on a sample -- a poll of likely voters, for instance, it will have a margin of error. Even the census has a margin of error -- despite our best efforts, we don't reach every single person. Know what the margin of error is, and know when a difference is within the margin of error. 

How do you calculate the margin of error? You don't. You let statisticians do that. 

## Confidence Interval
Most surveys have a confidence interval of 95 percent: if the survey were conducted 100 times that result would fall within the margin of error 95 times.

> "A confidence interval is a range around a measurement that conveys how precise the measurement is."

When we say all data is bad, this is part of what we're talking about. 

## Sampling

Sampling refers to the process of selecting a random and representative subset of the larger population to determine the characteristics of the whole population.

A good pollster will tell you what their sample size was. They can tell you what their methodology was.

If you are looking at an electoral poll conducted by a reputable polling agency, you can assume that they made some effort to reach a random sample of the population. Maybe they polled "likely voters" or maybe they polled everyone. They should say. But the sample was random and not self selected. On the other hand, lots of newsrooms and advocates use open polls to guage reader interest or get a conversation started. Those polls can be valuable as an engagement tool, but they tell you very little about what the public actually thinks. 

You'll come across a lot of polls in your career. Some are rigorous and reliable and some are totally bogus. You want to know what he pollsters asked and how they chose their samples. You want to know who paid for the study and what their agenda is. Survey design is complex.  You aren't statisticians. Unless you are, in which case you already know all of this. Otherwise, you need to find help.

The Pew research center did a great analysis about the order of questions: they found that if you ask people how they feel about gay marriage before you ask them how they feel about civil unions, they're more likely to say they favor civil unions. (this is from 2003 -- I'd gues the data is different today.)They repeated this with questions about Bush's record, congress working together. All kinds of things. 

# Writing with Numbers


## Fewer things, less stuff

Use "fewer" for things you can count: lumps of sugar, cars, people. Use "less" for things you can't count: milk,  traffic, homework. 

Dollar bills are countable, but dollar amounts are not. Years are countable, but ages are not. Confused? Refer to the AP Style book. 

## Fewer numbers, less confusion

Don't use every number just because you have it. Decide what your readers actually need to know. Do they need to know that there were 47 people on board the train? Or would "dozens" do? 

## False precision

If you are making calculations based on estimates, don't introduce false precision by giving numbers that are precise to the penny. Round off. 

+ Don't overwhelm the reader: choose the numbers that matter. 
+ Use visuals to tell the rest of the story
+ Don't hesitate to contact an expert if you are uncertain (find someone to turn to)
+ Always double check your math.
+ ALL DATA IS BAD!

Your job is to tell me, the reader, what is important here. Not to hit me over the head with numbers. 

If I need to see the figure for every month in the last year for four cities, make a chart. Don't rattle off numbers.

## Comparing Numbers

"as many as" describes a ratio -- if I have twice as many cookies as you, and you have two cookies, I have four. 

"more," "less" and "fewer" are statements about difference. 

# More Resources
It takes more than numeracy and some skepticism to cover numbers stories. Sarah Cohen's [Numbers in the Newsroom](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48822382) is a great primer on a range of numbers-driven stories. She goes well beyond the basics of language and calculation, deep into property taxes, school rankings, and economic forecasts.

Robert Niles' [Statistics Every Writer Should Know](http://www.robertniles.com/stats/) is clear and concise.
