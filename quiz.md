To do:

Look up...
* Stop and frisk numbers year over year (% change)
* High school graduation rates (if x% graduate within 4 years and y% within six years, what % do not graduate within 6 years?) 
* Graduation rate changes
* Property sales on one block in Harlem. Calculate the average and the mean.
* Express change in pre-k as a "three-fold" increase, or a % increased
* Some numbers on where our tax dollars go, for percents and comparison statements
* rise and fall by 25% -- doesn't get you back where you started. 

Survey (will not affect your grade. Honest)

* I [did | did not] need my cheatsheet to complete this quiz.
* This quiz was ...
  + So easy it was a waste of time
  + So hard my brain hurts
  + None of the above
  
* Should we spend more time on any of these concepts?  


# Percent Questions

## Q1
From [New York Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/city-adds-4k-pre-k-seats-april-23-deadline-approaches-article-1.1743797)

> "With the new slots, public schools will have 20,387 full-day seats in September — a 26% increase."


20,387 is 26% of what?
* The current number of Pre-K slots in public schools
* The total number of Pre-K slots that will be available this summer
* There is not enough information included here to say. (Write in: what additional information would you need?)


### Answer
The current number of Pre-K slots. If they chose C, not enough information, they may yet have a compelling reason.

## Q1 Variation

The [Daily News teported](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/city-adds-4k-pre-k-seats-april-23-deadline-approaches-article-1.1743797) last spring that the number of Pre-K spots in public schools will increase by 26% or 20,387. How many pre-k spots are there now (before the increase)? How many pre-k spots will there be, after the increase? Round to the nearest hundred. 

### Answer

20387 is 26% of the starting point. So the starting point is ~78412. There are 78,400 spots now. After the increase there will be 98,800 pre-k spots.

There's no such thing as a partial spot. So figures with decimal points are illogical. Without rounding, the figures are 78412 and 98799 -- give partial credit if they forgot to round. 


## Q2 

From [New York Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/city-adds-4k-pre-k-seats-april-23-deadline-approaches-article-1.1743797)
> "Overall, the city plans to add 33,000 new pre-K seats this fall — bringing the total citywide to 53,000. By the following year, it will jump to 73,000 — enough for every 4-year-old in the city."

1. All pre-k seats are either at programs run by community based organizations (CBOs) or in public schools. If the city is adding 20,387 seats in public schools, how many new seats will be in CBOs? 

2. What percent of new seats will be in CBOs?

3. How many seats were there before this initiative? 

4. What is the total % increase in seats, in CBOs and Public Schools?

### Answer 

1. 33,000 - 20387 = 12613 (Rounded to the nearst hundred, 12,600)
2. (12613/33000) * 100 = 38.22% (Rounded off, 38%)
3. 53000 - 33000 = 20000
4. 

Note: if you look at Q1, you can see that these numbers are wacky. That's why we do this!






# Essay Questions

*Adapted from Dan Nguyen's [NYU SCPS Course](http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/class/fall2013/class-final-2013/)*

## Sample question:

Thoroughout the city of Springfield, hospitals devote an average of 6% of their operating budgets to their cardiac surgery departments. Springfield Municipal, however, devotes 15% of its budget to cardiac surgery. Springfield Municipal averages 7 deaths per 1,000 open-heart surgeries, compared to a rate of 2.3 among other Springfield hospitals. Clearly, Springfield Municipal is misspending its cardiac funds.

Is this conclusion fair? Why or why not? 

### A good answer might consider...

+ We don't know how much these hospitals are spending per cardiac patient.

+ We don't know whether or not Springfield Municipal takes riskier or more challenging cases than other hospitals, or takes patients who are sicker to begin with. 

## Questions

1. For every 100,000 people, at least 48 die annually from knife-related accidents. In comparison, only 0.5 deaths per 100,000 people can be attributed to hand grenades. Therefore, hand grenades are nearly 100 times safer than knives.


2. In a random sampling of deaths among 18 to 40-year olds who consumed an average of 3 alcoholic beverages a week, nearly 35 percent were alcohol-related, (eg. accidents, liver disease). However, in a sampling of deaths among 80 to 100-year olds who consumed at least 5 alcoholic beverages a week, only 20 percent of deaths were alcohol-related. Therefore, we can conclude that drinking more alcohol will reduce your chances of having an alcohol-related death.

3. When a movie franchise has at least one sequel, the franchise averages $25 million more in revenue per movie than the average individual movie. Therefore, given an original screenplay, a movie studio should prepare to film a sequel as soon as possible, in order to maximize revenue.

4. From the year 2008 to 2012, SAT scores among Springfield High seniors jumped 38%. Shelbyville High seniors, however, had a 1% drop in overall SAT scores. Therefore, we can conclude that Springfield High graduates will have a better chance of going to a prestigious college.

5. In the year 2000, the suburb Deerfield had a deer population that averaged 2.4 per acre. In that year, there were only 3,800 concealed-carry firearm permits on file for Deerfield residents. In 2010, however, the deer population fell to an average of 0.6 an acre, whereas concealed-carry firearm permits increased to more than 40,000. From this, we can conclude that Deerfield gun ownership is to blame for the decrease in deer population.


### Answers

1. We don't know how the number of knives compares to the number of hand grenades -- far more people have access to knives than to hand grenades.

2. We would need to compare people within the same age group to draw that conclusion. People in their 80s die of many things related to old age. 

3. Film studios only produce sequels to successful films.
